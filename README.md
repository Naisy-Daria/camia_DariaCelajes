Project Title: Budget Tracker

#Project Description
This is a simple Python program that helps manage and display a person's budget.

#Problem Statement:
Many people find it difficult to keep track of their spending because they rely on messy note-taking or forget to record their expenses consistently. This lack of organization leads to overspending, financial stress, and difficulty saving money. The real problem is the absence of a simple and organized system that allows users to monitor their daily expenses and remaining budgets in real-time.
This project aims to solve that problem by creating a Budget Tracker program that automatically updates a person’s remaining budget each time they record an expense. It helps users visualize where their money goes, make better financial decisions, and develop better budgeting habits.

#Project Objective (SMART Framework):
Specific: To create a Python program that helps users monitor and manage their weekly budget by tracking expenses under specific categories.
Measurable: The program will display updated category and total budget balances after every recorded expense.
Achievable: The project will be developed using basic Python programming concepts and completed by the end of the school year.
Relevant: The project promotes financial awareness and responsible spending habits.
Time-bound: The program will be fully developed and functional by the end of the 4th Quarter.
Overall Objective:
To design and implement a Python-based Budget Tracker that helps users monitor weekly spending, prevent overspending, and build better budgeting habits through categorized expense tracking and automatic budget updates.

#Features:
1. Budget Input – Allows the user to enter their original weekly budget.
2. Category Creation – Lets the user create multiple expense categories such as food, transport, or entertainment.
3. Category Budget Allocation – Enables the user to assign an initial weekly budget to each category.
4. Expense Recording – Allows the user to input daily expenses for specific categories.
5. Automatic Budget Update – Deducts the spent amount from the category budget and recalculates the remaining balance.
6. Weekly Balance Calculation – Updates and displays the user’s remaining total weekly budget based on all category expenses.
7. Data Display – Presents a summary showing each category, its initial budget, total spent, and remaining balance.
8. Continuous Tracking – Lets the user enter new expenses throughout the week and see updated results.

#How to Run the Program
1. Make sure Python is installed on your device.
2. Run the program file (for example, budget_tracker.py).
3. Enter your original weekly budget.
4. Add the expense categories you want to track.
5. Assign an initial budget for each category.
6. Record your daily spending for specific categories.
7. View the updated remaining balance for each category and your total weekly budget.
