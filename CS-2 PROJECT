Problem Statement:
I often find it hard to keep track of my income and expenses.
Writing them down or using notes can be messy and confusing, which sometimes leads me to overspend without realizing it. 
To solve this, I want to create a Budget Tracker program in Python that will help me record my income and expenses, categorize them, and see a clear summary of my balance. 
aThis way, I can manage my money better and become more aware of my spending habits.

Description:
We will design our program in an organized manner like categorizing our expenses (eg. Food and transportation) and show how much we spent. 
The program will allow the user to easily edit it to input their expenses and money to keep the tracker updated. 
We will make sure it is accurate and has no mistakes like data loss, user errors, scalability issues, and usability problems.
We will have data validation features that allows only numerical inputs for the money and that it does not exceed the set budget.
